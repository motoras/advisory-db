# ShmWriter allows sending non-Send type across threads

Affected versions of this crate implement `Send` for `ShmWriter<H>` without requiring `H: Send`. This allows users to send `H: !Send` to other threads, which can potentially lead to data races and undefined behavior.

The issue was corrected as suggested, by adding the `H: Send` trait bound to `ShmWriter`'s Send implementation.
